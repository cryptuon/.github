### Hi! I am [@cryptuon](https://twitter.com/cryptuon) (Cryptuon Research)

We are a blockchain research and development company. 

We are lead by [@dipankar](https://github.com/dipankar), who is a software architect and researcher based out of Scotland. 

We have been busy researching and publishing papers in various area of blockchain. We have made contributions in MEV, Atomic transactions across rollups, and various other areas.

One of our works ["Universal Atomic Composability"](https://github.com/cryptuon/tesseract-paper) was recently selected by A16Z's crypto startup school for interview. We are now prototyping the [protocol](https://github.com/cryptuon/tesseract) and seeking customers/partners. Some of our work has made its way into whitepaper of emerging protocols. 

Please do contact us, if our work is of interest. ðŸ¤“
